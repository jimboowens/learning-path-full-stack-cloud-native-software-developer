## Keyboard Shortcut Bindings

If you hate having to move your hand to get to the arrow, home, and end keys to move the cursor, you may want to change your key bindings

* Navigate to File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts
* cursorDown = control + windows key + k
* cursorDownSelect = control + alt + k
* cursorUp = control + windows key + i
* cursorUpSelect = control + alt + i
* cursorRight = control + windows key + l
* cursorRightSelect = control + alt + l
* cursorLeft = control + windows key + j
* cursorLeftSelect = control + alt + j
* cursorWordEndRight = control + shift + l
* cursorWordStartLeft = control + shift + j
