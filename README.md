# Learning Path Overview

## Goals

The goal of this learning path is to provide an optimized path for learning to become a:

- holistic
- cloud-native
- software developer and
- digital business application system designer-builder-operator
- who can operate within a
  - multi-member
  - geographically distributed
  - digital business capability
  - development and delivery team
- to deliver software that can run on
  - server computer systems
  - web browsers
  - mobile devices
  - IoT devices
  - Kubernetes
  - public cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Digital Ocean, etc.)

## How To Use This Document

This document is NOT a tutorial.

It is an outline and sequence of topics that a person who wants to become a proficient designer-builder-operator of cloud native digital business application systems.  It is intended to give a path for self-motivated learners to gain an understanding of the space.

For each topic, there is a collection of links to educational content that the learner can consume to gain knowledge and skills about that topic.

THERE IS A BROAD AND DEEP RANGE OF SUBJECTS that is covered.  I recommend that the learner go through the whole sequence at the basic level of each topic first.  This will give the learner the bigger picture of how the topics related to one another.  Afterwards, the learner can dive deeper into more advanced areas of each topic.

Resource links are also provided for further exploration and awareness.

The learner is expected and encouraged to explore subjects and find other information resources and tools to expand and fill there knowledge, skills, and capabilities. 

## Prerequisite Knowledge, Skills, & Behavior

- Self-motivate learner
- Curiosity to explore subjects
- Ability to search the internet for quality information to figure out how to best do something
- Ability to integrate information into a system for doing things
- Proficiency in using Microsoft Windows 10

## Philosophy

> “All teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through service interfaces.  There will be no other form of interprocess communication allowed:  no direct linking, no direct reads of another team’s data store, no shared-memory model, no back-doors whatsoever.  The only communication allowed is via service interface calls over the network.  Anyone who doesn’t do this will be fired.”  (Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon)

The above quote from Jeff Bezos expresses the changes in application system design characteristics that are required to build scalable and responsive systems that satisfies today's (2020) user expectations while enabling hundreds / thousands of individual teams to quickly improve digital services with lowered costs and higher quality.  Such changes require seasoned IT professionals to break old paradigms and embrace and develop new ones.  Sometimes people need the threat of losing their income before they are willing to change themselves as seems to be the case at Amazon years ago.

The philosophy behind this learning path is that the learner welcomes the opporunity to transform him/herself and takes the initiative to discover and pave new paths for him/herself and his/her teams.  It is not for the faint of heart.  If you need to be spoon-fed, this learning path may not be for you.  However, if you are willing engage yourself in this journey to work through the challenging content and integrate the many different pieces in your mind, I believe that you will become a very capable person in transforming society in a digitizing economy.

## Why JavaScript

JavaScript is the primary programming language used in this learning path.  The reasons for this are as follows:

- a software developer will need to use JavaScript to develop web user interface applications
- JavaScript can be used to develop remote API and service applications using technologies like Node.js
- JavaScript can be used to develop applications that run within Linux containers and orchestrated on Kubernetes
- JavaScript can be used to develop applications that run on serverless computing platforms like AWS Lambda, GCP Cloud Functions, Azure Functions, Knative, etc.
- JavaScript can be used to develop applications that run natively on mobile device operating systems, desktop operating systems, and IoT device operating systems
- JavaScript can be used to develop applications that run on JavaScript / Wasm Virtual Machine compute nodes provided by internet content delivery network service providers to generate dynamic content close to consumers wherever they are at on Earth
- JavaScript can be used to develop applications that run on JavaScript / Wasm Virtual Machine compute nodes provided by mobile network service providers located at their wireless service access point sites that are near their wireless towers
- JavaScript and WebAssembly can be use to integrate programs written in other languages such as C/C++, C#, F#, Python, Rust, Java, Groovy, Scala, Kotlin, etc.

As you can see, you can get *A LOT OF MILEAGE* from learning to develop applications using JavaScript and the JavaScript / Wasm Virtual Machine that run everywhere throughout the entire technology stack and across the entire n-tiers of compute resources.
